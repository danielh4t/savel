SÃ¤vel (_music note_, _melody_ in Finnish) is a open-source application that connects different music services and
provides a unified experience to follow your favorite artists.

## How to build the Backend

### 1. Create a configuration file with the API keys

Each service requires a set of keys in order to send requests. The keys are stored in a configuration file that is not
tracked by the version control system. The file must be created in the following path:

```
../src/main/resources/application.conf
```

The file must have the following structure:

```hocon
api {
    spotify {
        clientId = "<my-client-id>"
        clientSecret = "<my-client-secret>"
    }
}
```

### 2. Generate a shadowJar

The project uses the Gradle build system and the shadowJar plugin to generate a fat jar with all dependencies. To
generate the jar, run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew shadowJar
```

### 3. Build the Docker image

The project provides a Dockerfile to build the image. To build the image, run the following command:

```shell
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t igorescodro/savel:latest --load .
```
